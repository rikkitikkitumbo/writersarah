When I write words, I write them really good so you keep on reading.
  I've always been good with words I guess that's what I mean, I think I saw I mean... err, yes
  but it's all wrong.  That is I think I disagree.

  &nbsp &nbsp But that being said, I didn't really like the
  beatles in that phase.  My favorite Beatles phase would probably be like Rubber Soul or Revolver.  I think
  that was a good mix between short sing-songy pop songs and more creative, both musically and production-wise.
  I wonder what THEY thought of their different phases...  I once saw a John Lennon interview where he was saying
  that he thought their best phase was when they were on Ed Sullivan.  I kind of agree...
